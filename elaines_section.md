# Elaine's Individual Section

## 1. New e-Commerce site:

I believe that the **Agile Model** is the best fit for the process
of this software developement because of how there are new interns
and hires, this model is the best for having a mixed-skill team.
This model also allows feedback from the customer and can constantly
improve the final product.

## 2. Dental office site

I also believe that the **Agile Model** is the best fit for this
process for this situation because of how flexible and user-focused
this model can be. It's also perfect for evolving the software as
we go along and wants to continue adding more features in the future.
Agile Model allows more flexibility and updates.

## 3. Nuclear Power Plant

I believe that the **Spiral Model** is the best fit for this software
development process because of how much risk there is when creating
this piece of software. The Spiral Model tackles this risk at the very
beginning and is very heaving on testing and risk-preventative.
