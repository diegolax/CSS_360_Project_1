# Elaine's Individual Section

## 1. New e-Commerce site:

I believe that the **Agile Model** is the best fit for the process
of this software developement because of how there are new interns
and hires, this model is the best for having a mixed-skill team.
This model also allows feedback from the customer and can constantly
improve the final product.

## 2. Dental office site

I also believe that the **Agile Model** is the best fit for this
process for this situation because of how flexible and user-focused
this model can be. It's also perfect for evolving the software as
we go along and wants to continue adding more features in the future.
Agile Model allows more flexibility and updates.

## 3. Nuclear Power Plant

I believe that the **Spiral Model** is the best fit for this software
development process because of how much risk there is when creating
this piece of software. The Spiral Model tackles this risk at the very
beginning and is very heaving on testing and risk-preventative.

## 4. Department of Transportation

I believe that the **Waterfall Model** is the best fit for this software
development process because the requirements are laid out perfectly and
the team is experienced. Not only did the Department of Transportation
incredibly detailed with what is required, but my team has done previous
transporation work in the past. Waterfall is perfect because once you create
one step, and finish the next, it can keep going with clear criterias and 
not that many changes.

## 5. Reducing Traffic

I believe that the **Incremental Model** is the best fit for this software
development process because it allows us to build the software in parts where
each part of this software depends on the other. Incremental model is best because
once you've programmed the start of car tracking, then it could add traffic sensors,
read the data, and from there, create billboards.
