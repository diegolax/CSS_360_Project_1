## #1: New E-Commerce Site
The **incremental** model would work best, because the project is a web-based application in which features can be added in stages,
and it does not involve work with other companies.
It does require work between multiple teams and specific requirements, so the agile model would likely be too disorganized for this project.

## #2: Dental Office Site
The **agile** model would work best, because the project is a web-based application that is planned needs to get new features over time.
The agile model is well-suited for continually adding new features, and can accommodate the customer's evolving plans for the site.
Work with other teams or companies is not anticipated, so complexity should not be a problem.

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant
The **waterfall** model is most appropriate, because the deliverable is a safety-critical system.
Additionally, the software is not expected to be changed for many years, so fixing bugs before release is very important.
Work with outside companies is also a possibility, so clear and unchanging requirements are essential.

## #4: Department of Transportation
The **incremental** model would work best, because the deliverable is a web-based application that can be updated easily.
The requirments are very clear, and unlikely to change, so the agile model is not necessary.
Ongoing work with outside teams is not expected, so coordination will not be a problem.
