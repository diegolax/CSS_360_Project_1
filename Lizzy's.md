## 1. New e-Commerce site:
_Main ideas:_ using the same tools with minimal changes and working with developers you know, new hires and interns.

At the mention of reusing the PerfectApparel’s tools, the **integration and configuration** method came to mind. This method framework is literally built on reusing components and applications, so this would be the best one to utilize.

## 3. Nuclear Power Plant:
_Main points:_ past nuclear power plant failures motivate you to make this program very safe.

In the textbook, the **waterfall method** is described as best being used for "critical systems where there is a need for extensive safety and security analysis." Therefore, this method should be used.

## 4. Department of Transportation: 
_Main points:_ distributed application storing data on the Cloud. Department sends 100 pages of specifications. Experienced staff, 18 months estimation with 10 software developers.

Since this isn’t an embedded system and can/is expected to be updated with new information, the **agile method** should be used. The experience the coworkers and the quick deadline also points to that method.

## 6. Educational Game
_Main points:_ these keywords are mentioned in the description: experienced coworkers, quickly, changing requirements.

The **agile method** fits best with the situation. The games must be delivered quickly and presented to the team of teachers and staff, and the requirements are guaranteed to change. The agile method is the only method that can offer that kind of flexibility.
