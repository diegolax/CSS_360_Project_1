## Best Software Lifecycle Models for Each Scenario
### By: Softmeow Enginyas

### 1. E - Commerce Site: *Integration and Configuration*
* **Why:** We chose integration because This method framework is literally built on reusing components and
applications, so this would be the best one to utilize.
* **Other models we considered:** we considered incremental and waterfall as other models but decided not to
because we figured that integration and configuration would be easier for changes to be adapted and for 
a team that mixed with different skillsets.
*  **Important Aspects:**
1. The Development Team is consisted of people with different skill sets.
2. Pre-existing templates that would help with coding.

### 2. Dental Office SIte: *Agile Model*
* **Why:** 
* **Other models we considered:**
* **Important Aspects:**
1. e
2. e

### 3. Nuclear Power Plant: Waterfall Model
* **Why:** The deliverable is a safety-critical system, so it mus tbe developed slowly and cautiously. In the textbook,
the waterfall method is described as best being used for "critical systems where there is a need for extensive safety 
and security analysis." The software is not expected to be changed for many years, so fixing bugs before release is very
important. The waterfall method ensures that everything is well checked and test before release, which is perfect for
the power plant's system. 
* **Other models we considered:** Almost everyone in the group had come to the same conclusion, that waterfall would be
best in this case. The only outlier was the mention of the spiral method, which is a variation of the waterfall method. 
But the variation didn't offer anything useful compared, so waterfall was chosen.
* **Important Aspects:**
1. This scenario was safety-critical
2. Software was not expected to be changed along the lines of the future

### 4. Department of Transportation



2. Dental Office Site -> agile model
Why: The model allows for changes throughout the project
   lifecycle. This means your friend can give you feedback and let you know about the
   features they want. Assuming you are experienced in building a website since your dentist friend asked, this method would work well.

3. Nuclear Power Plant -> waterfall model
Why: The deliverable is a safety-critical system, so it must be developed slowly and cautiously. Additionally, the software is not expected to be changed for many years, so fixing bugs before release is very important.

4. Department of Transportation -> integration and configuration
Why: As stated, we have already created the solutions earlier so it should be easy to adapt them to our situation. It will also ensure we can meet this deadline in a timely manner.

5. Reducing Traffic -> Waterfall model
Why: Since the team has experience with embedded
   systems they are probably used to this model. This software also needs to be reliable
   since it will be used everyday with a government branch.

6. Educational game -> agile model
Why: 

7. Global health -> incremental
Why:
