# Marco's SDLC Proposals
## #1: New e-Commerce site

<p>Due to already existing systems in PerfectApparel, we should utilize an **integration and configuration** model to take advantage of that.
After analyzing their exisiting code, it should be simple to modify their code to generate the web pages required.
</p>

## #2: Dental Office Site

<p>A **waterfall** model would work well with the parameters of this project. We know just about all of the functionality that our client wants so it'll be easy to organize the work.
Since there is not rush, we can focus on these exact goals with no added interference.
</p>

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant

<p>Using a **waterfall** model will enhance the safety and security of the software created. Since we need to ensure that the power plant does not fail, we need to be clear on the safety
specifications at the very beginning, something that this model does well at.
</p>

## #4: Department of Transportation

<p>Due to our experience in the transportation realm, **integration and configuration** will be most useful to use. As stated, we have already created the solutions earlier so it should be
easy to adapt them to our situation. It will also ensure we can meet this deadline in a timely manner.
</p>

## #5: Reducing Traffic

<p>With our educated team **integration and configuration** of our existing software is optimal. I am sure we can find some porgrams that can be adapted to provide the data and 
functions to monitor traffic.
</p>

## #6: Educational Game

<p>Using an **incremental development** model would be smart to mitigate the effect extra changes would have on us. There are many clients that will be wanting different things from our
game so I bet they will also have many requirements that we should be ready to implement at a moment's notice.
</p>

## #7: Global Health

<p> In order to keep producing results, an **incremental development** model would ensure we are abel to have deliverables. We would be able to deliver and have results from clients,
which in turn would allow us to recieve more grants after our impact has been evaluated early. This is better than going through a long "Waterfall" cycle and risk running out of money.
