# Marco's SDLC Proposals
## #1: New e-Commerce site

<p>Due to already existing systems in PerfectApparel, we should utilize an **integration and configuration** model to take advantage of that.
After analyzing their exisiting code, it should be simple to modify their code to generate the web pages required.
</p>

## #2: Dental Office Site

<p>A **waterfall** model would work well with the parameters of this project. We know just about all of the functionality that our client wants so it'll be easy to organize the work.
Since there is not rush, we can focus on these exact goals with no added interference.
